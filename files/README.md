# Main Execution File: 
`learn_#.js`  

All other `.json` files are forms of information storage.  

*note: ignore `.DS_Store` file (identifies file-viewing layout in computer desktops)* 

# Code Flowchart  

Use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to see flowchart  
* Upload `.xml` or `.drawio` file to view  

***Flowchart also contains developer notes***  

**CAUTION:** `.xml` and `.drawio` file is ***only a tag*** to real xml file (housed in draw.io database)
  * Be conscious of exporting real file once in a while. Store in folder `history/flowcharts`.
  * Export Preference: `.svg`  

*note: `.svg` files can opened via browsers online or offline*  
*note: Github can load `.svg` files. However, **better to right click and open in new tab** (allows zoom-in)*
