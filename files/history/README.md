# NOTES

### `Learn_#.js`  

Each new `learn_#.js` file contains significant add-ons, using the `prior learn_#.js` file content.  

The `learn.js` file is the simplest and 1st made.  

The higher # `learn_#.js` files are consequntianlly more complex, built on functioning aspects of the prior build.  
* Use prior builds to help understand add-ons.
